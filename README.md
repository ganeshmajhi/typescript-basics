| ----------- | ----------- |
| Static  | Java, C, C++, Rust, Go |
| Dynamic| **Javascript**, Python, Ruby, PHP |

# PROS and CONS

| Pros | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| More Robust | More Code to Write |
| Easily Spot Bugs | More to learn |
| Predicitbility | Required Compilation |
| Popular | Not True Static Typing |
| Readability |  |

# Compiling Typescript

- Typescript uses **.ts** and **.tsx** extensions.
- **TSC** (TypeScript Compiler) is used to compile .ts file down to js.
